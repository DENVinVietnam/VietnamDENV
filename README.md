This repository is created to include the code and data related to the dissertation titled "Modelling the Effect of Serum Antibody on Dengue Infection in Vietnam Using Test-negative Design". It describes a multinomial regression model estimating the impacts of pre-existing antibody levels on subsequent infections and a compartmental model dynamically integrating these impacts to predict the future dengue dynamics in Vietnam.

Please find S1-S3 Text to see the instructions for running S1-S3 Code, respectively.
